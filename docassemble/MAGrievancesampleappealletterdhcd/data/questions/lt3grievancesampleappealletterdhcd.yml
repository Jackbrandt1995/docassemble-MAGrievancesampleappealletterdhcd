id: Write an Appeal to the Department of Housing and Community Development
question: |
  Write an Appeal to the Department of Housing and Community Development
subquestion: |
  Only use this form if you are in STATE PUBLIC HOUSING! If you are in Federal housing, you will have to fill out a different form.
  
  State regulations provide that either you or the housing authority have the right to ask the housing authority’s Board of Commissioners to review a grievance decision in most cases.91 This is called an appeal. The only time that you cannot appeal a grievance hearing is if a hearing officer or panel approved the termination of your lease. You do not have to move, however, until a court orders you to. Go to MassLegalHelp.org for more information on evictions. (Note: The Boston Housing Authority does not have a Board of Commissioners, so grievance appeals go to the administrator or the person she chooses.)
  
  To file an appeal, a tenant or housing authority must submit a written letter to the housing authority’s Board of Commissioners (or for the Boston Housing Authority, the appropriate administrator) within 14 days of mailing or other delivery of the hearing officer’s or panel’s decision. An appeal can be sought if you or the housing authority believe that the decision was not supported by the facts or did not correctly apply applicable laws, regulations, rules, or policies, or that the matter was not something subject to the grievance procedure.
